    ✉️ 100 wallets in total.
    <br/>
    🚚 48 of those wallets have been <strong>claimed</strong>, meaning that a recipient has spent the
    funds at least once
    (probably sweeping to an address that they control).
    <br/>
    💸 14 of the claimed wallets have had at least one additional transaction, after they were claimed.
